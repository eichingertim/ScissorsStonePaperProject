## Comment

This simple Scissor-Stone-Paper Project was my first real project i finished by learning python. I think for starting a new language this is a perfect entry for beginners.

##Information

Created in python, this project is a very simple implementation of the fun game called Scissor-Stone-Paper played with hands in real life.
